# Contributing

Thanks for being interested in contributing to the Foundation for Public Code blog.
Below we hope to have instructions that make it clear how to do so successfully.
We will focus on how to submit a blog post, but you are of course welcome to proofread and comment on issues and pull requests as well.

## Submitting a blog post

If you would like to propose a new idea for a blog post, please [create an issue](https://github.com/publiccodenet/blog/issues/new/choose) and pitch your idea first.
This can save you time if it turns out that your idea doesn't fit this blog.

If you have already been in contact with Foundation for Public Code staff about a blog topic and/or been invited to write a blog post, feel free to to [make a pull request](#making-a-pull-request).

### Topics we are looking for

We are looking for blog posts that are about public code, meaning is software with a public purpose, developed by and for public organizations.
We are specifically interested in stories, case studies or learnings from hands-on collaborations around the development and/or reuse of codebases across different contexts.
We might reject ideas that are only tangentially interesting to our audience, such as topics related to "pure" civic tech, where the codebase might have a public purpose, but did not involve public organizations collaborating.

## Making a pull request

First take a look at the process outlined in our [blogging guide](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/communication/blogging.html).
In addition to that, you should include this boiler plate introduction just beneath your first heading:

```
*This is a blog post by [your name (you may link this to a profile page elsewhere)].*
*The views expressed are the authorâ€™s alone and not necessarily held by the Foundation for Public Code.*
```

Please state your desired publication date both in the front matter as well as in the pull request itself.
This makes it easier for us to prioritize reviews and ensure it fits into our overall publishing schedule.
Unless you have communicated with us specifically about the blog post, also note that if your publishing date is in the very near future (in the next two days) we might not be able to accommodate your suggestion due to other assignments.

## License

We aim to publish as freely as possible, and that unless stated otherwise, your text will be [licensed CC 0](LICENSE.md).
For clarity, all media should have an explicit license statement accompanying it.
