# Contributing

Thanks for being interested in contributing to the blog of Foundation for Public Code.
Below we hope to have instructions that makes it clear to you how to do so successfully.
We will focus on how to submit a blog post, but you are of course welcome in proofreading, commenting on issues and pull requests as well.

## Submitting a blog post

There are two common paths. Either you already communicated with people at the Foundation for Public Code and they invited you to write a blog post on a specific topic. If so, you can move directly to [Making a pull request](#making-a-pull-request).

If not, and this is your first contact with us about this blog post, please [create an issue](https://github.com/publiccodenet/blog/issues/new/choose) and pitch your idea before writing it.
This can save you time if it turns out that your idea doesn't fit this blog.

### Topics we are looking for

We are looking for blog posts that are about public code, that is software with a public purpose, developed by and for public organizations.
We are specifically looking for experiences of collaboration in development or reuse of codebases across contexts.
We might reject ideas that are only tangentially interesting to our audience, for example "pure" civic tech topics, where the codebase might have a public purpose, but no public organization were part of the development.

## Making a pull request

The general process in [this guide](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/communication/blogging.html) applies when contributing a blog post as a pull request.
In addition to that, you should include this boiler plate introduction just beneath your first heading:

```
*This is a blog post by [your name (you may link this to a profile page elsewhere)].*
*The views expressed are the authorâ€™s alone and not necessarily held by the Foundation for Public Code.*
```

Although you add your wanted publication date in the front matter, please also state this in pull request itself.
It makes it easier for us to prioritize reviews and to make sure it fit into our overall publishing schedule.
Unless you have communicated with us specifically about the blog post, also note that if your publishing date is in the very near future (in the next two days) we might not be able to accommodate your suggestion purely due to other assignments.

## License

Do note that we aim to publish as freely as possible, and that unless stated otherwise, your text will be [licensed CC 0](LICENSE.md).
For clarity, all media should have an explicit license statement accompanying it.
