## Notes

We started by reviewing [the notes from the last session](https://blog.publiccode.net/community%20call/2022/09/08/pruning-the-oldest-issues.html):

* [Add how the Standard supports the SDGs to the intro #358](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/358) - transferred to publiccode.net repository

Then we continued with:

* [Create video on contributing to the Standard #361](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/361) - closed for now, can be re-opened if someone wants to work on it
* [Add something about required skills in a codebase? #362](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/362) - closed with comment
* [Reviews of contributions within 2 business days lacks rationale and further reading #367](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/367) - a [pull request](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/pull/725) with additions to Why this is important was made
* [Ambiguous sentence related to security #368](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/368) - already fixed, closed
* [Glossary items are not uniform #369](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/369) - comments made, stays open
* [Nice is not enough information on why a link is further reading #370](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/370) - comment made, stays open until sentence is added to the implementation guide
