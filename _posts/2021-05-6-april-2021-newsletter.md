# Newsletter: April 2021

Welcome to our April newsletter! April included two public holidays, so our month was a bit more relaxed than usual.

Our highlights this month were:

* the [community version of Jitsi Meet](https://github.com/publiccodenet/about/blob/develop/activities/tool-management/jitsi-guides.md) is ready to use
* we're very close to publishing our first annual report (our first financial year ran 2019-2020)

In May, join us for:

* 6 May: [Podcast episode 5 livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPF_3DpNA0A) - we'll talk to Amy van Someren about 's-Hertogenbosch's experience as the first Signalen replicator
* 6 May: Standard for Public Code [community call on vendor and platform independence](https://hackmd.io/-OegeqvoThCbAsw3c3gIjw)
* 20 May: Foundation for Public Code community call - [help pick the topic](https://github.com/publiccodenet/blog/issues/183)!

## Codebase stewardship

Things are ticking along in the [codebases we steward](https://publiccode.net/codebases/).

OpenZaak had a busy month:

* the codebase now [meets the Standard for Public Code criterion 'Document maturity'](https://github.com/open-zaak/open-zaak/pull/924). Overall, [OpenZaak meets 11 of the 15 Standard criteria](https://github.com/open-zaak/open-zaak/pull/924)
* the [Association of Netherlands Municipalities (VNG) has strengthened their guidance](https://web.archive.org/web/20210518193530/https://www.vngrealisatie.nl/nieuws/api-standaarden-zaakgericht-werken-vanaf-1-april) that Dutch municipalities use the open data standards (APIs) underpinning OpenZaak, ahead of the APIs becoming mandatory in 2022

The Signalen community has been hard at work - we'll have more to share next month. In the meantime, [read an update on what's next for Signalen](https://commonground.nl/news/view/2a13308d-872e-4b98-8dff-d4d3bcb36586/steeds-meer-gemeenten-maken-gebruik-van-signalen?utm_medium) from a Signalen community member (in Dutch).

The [Omgevingsbeleid front end repository is now public](https://github.com/Provincie-Zuid-Holland/Omgevingsbeleid-Frontend)!

The codebase stewards ran a governance workshop with the [OpenStad community](https://openstad.org/).

## Running the Foundation for Public Code

We've been focused on:

* Our first annual report, including establishing templates for appropriate annual financial reporting. The report will be published shortly
* Creating a salary framework and implementing performance management; including meeting with experts for advice
* We've built a community Jitsi instance for which [anyone can sign up to create an account](https://meet.community.publiccode.net/accountmanager/register/). It includes a user interface we've built using the open source software we started out with. The repository to fork the software will be available soon
* Migrating from Travis to Github Actions for our own repos
* Opening up our [Nextcloud](https://collaboration.publiccode.net/) instance for our community. They can use ONLYOFFICE to collaborate on office documents in real-time, or use it for secure file sharing

We expect some of these projects to launch later this month - keep an eye out!

## Membership

We've had ongoing conversations this month with 4 cities, plus conversations about national-level support or membership with civil servants from 2 countries.

## Outreach

Catch up with:

* Sivan PÃ¤tsch's article [Open enables public sector digital transformation in the Netherlands](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/open-source-observatory-osor/news/we-liberated-our-own-data-silos-market) - an overview of OpenZaak's development on the [Open Source Observatory and Repository](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/open-source-observatory-osor) (OSOR)
* our codebase steward Alba's blogpost about how we supported the [Signalen community day](https://blog.publiccode.net/signalen/2021/04/09/three-ways-we-supported-the-past-signalen-community-meetup.html) in March
* the notes from our [April Standard for Public Code community call](https://blog.publiccode.net/community%20call/2021/04/12/notes-from-community-call-1-april-2021.html) on backlog pruning
* our April Foundation for Public Code community call was about our search for new board members - [watch the recording](https://youtu.be/igmbZDuv8rg)

See you next month! Or say hi in the meantime.
