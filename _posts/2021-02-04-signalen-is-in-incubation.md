# Signalen is in incubation! Hurrah!

![Signalen logo]({{site.url}}/assets/signalen_logo.png)

We are delighted to announce that the [Signalen codebase](https://web.archive.org/web/20210120093134/https://signalen.org/en/) is now in incubation with the [Foundation for Public Code](https://publiccode.net).

During [incubation](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/codebase-stewardship/lifecycle.html), a codebase community works to make the codebase fully [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net/) compliant (with our support).

This is an important milestone in the Signalen community's ambitions, reflecting their strong commitment to openness and collaboration.

After nearly a year in assessment, we're honored they've chosen to work more closely with us in the future, and proud the Standard has proven useful for the Signalen community.
