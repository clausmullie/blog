## Log

Following the [community call in April](https://blog.publiccode.net/community%20call/2021/04/12/notes-from-community-call-1-april-2021.html) we continue reviewing our oldest Standard for Public Code issues. These were the ones we got through:

* [#168 Include section on 'how to implement standard in your organisation'?](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/168) - important issue, but should not be in the standard, transferred to About.
