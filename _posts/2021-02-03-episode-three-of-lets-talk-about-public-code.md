# Episode three of Let's talk about public code!

In the third episode we talked to Sergei Maertens from Maykin Media and Tjerk Vaags from Contezza.
How can you design a process for handling Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures in a collaborative codebase?
We learned how they handled a security issue in OpenZaak. Hopefully this will inspire you as you consider what your project would do in the same situation.
