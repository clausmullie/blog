# Demodam, Signalen and we're hiring! May 2021 newsletter

Hi and welcome to the May 2021 Foundation for Public Code newsletter.

## Highlights from May

We're all quite excited about these:

- We've started supporting [Demodam](https://www.meetup.com/Code-For-NL/events/278257660/), a website for a fictional municipality to showcase reusable digital services and components, developed by the [Dutch municipal open source community Common Ground](https://commonground.nl/) - keep an eye out for more Demodam developments!
- In our [5th Let's Talk About Public Code podcast episode](https://podcast.publiccode.net/), we spoke with Amy van Someren from the municipality 's-Hertogenbosch. We discussed their positive experience as the first reusers of the [Signalen codebase](https://signalen.org/en/).
- [We're recruiting a storyteller/communications editor](https://publiccode.net/careers/communications-editor.html), to help us better explain why public code matters to a wider range of people. Please share with your networks!

## Upcoming events

- 10 June: Based on the success of our first Standard backlog pruning call in May, we'll host this regularly on the 2nd Thursday of the month
- 17 June: Join our regular Foundation for Public Code community call. Please [help us pick the topic](https://github.com/publiccodenet/blog/issues/198) - what would you most like to talk about with us?

- 28 June-2 July: Jan will also be speaking at the [Open Source Summit, 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210630211728/https://oss2021.saintgits.org/), hosted by the Open Source Club of Saintgits College of Engineering (India)

## Codebase stewardship news

Our codebase stewardship team is really enjoying their work at the moment. As a reminder, [the codebases we steward](https://publiccode.net/codebases/) are OpenZaak, Signalen, Digital Omgevingsbeleid and (now!) Demodam.

OpenZaak experienced 2 milestones this month:

- [new release 1.4.0](https://github.com/open-zaak/open-zaak/releases/tag/1.4.0)
- [helpful blogpost on a potential vulnerability](https://openzaak.org/en/news/2021-04-16-codecov-security-update/) that didn't affect the codebase

The Signalen community is maturing and growing:

- Amy van Someren held a demo session for 25 enthusiastic people from 2 municipalities
- with steady work together to develop a common roadmap that's ready to be shared publicly next month. It's a joy to see community members working together to identify overlaps in priorities
- Signalen was [a featured case study](https://www.publieksdiensten.nl/nieuws/gemeentedelers-samenwerken-aan-leefbaarheid-met-signalen) for Dutch municipalities, including a short video overview (in Dutch)

Since Digital Omgevingsbeleid was put into public repositories last month, we've started actively stewarding the codebase - focusing especially on tests.

There are 2 codebases currently in assessment: OpenZaakBrug and Demodam. Codebase stewards also met with teams from 2 other codebases this month.

We've started to interview policy experts on how to make the Standard more useful for them - if you know someone we should speak with, please point them our way!
