# Notes from community call - 21 November 2019

For transparency, we're sharing the update we prepared for this community call even though no new points were raised on it.

## Update from the Foundation

* The [first version of the Governance Exercise](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/workshops/governance-exercise.html) is available, and it will turn [into a game](https://github.com/publiccodenet/governance-game)
* We attended [DecidimFest 2019](https://meta.decidim.org/conferences/decidimfest19), where we met and connected with awesome people and could learn from their experiences. [Ben](https://publiccode.net/team/ben-cerveny.html) is back in Barcelona at Smart City World Expo now, where we assume he's doing more of the same! [Here are our English notes from (some of) the Spanish and Catalan presentations](https://hackmd.io/_hNC01HAT1-6Xr21HDsQRg).
* We participated in [OSS Beyond 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20210103172000/https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/workshop-about-future-open-source-software-and-open-source-hardware) organized by the European Commission in Brussels.
    * The wider OSS (open source software) community delivered a clear message on how important it is for the Commission to keep collaborating on open source.
    * We crowdsourced notes that turned out great: [day 1](https://hackmd.io/Z552wq0wT46zD7jibJj_Tg), [day 2](https://hackmd.io/OJwtL1gnScqLv8s4Zl45lA).
