# Pruning the oldest issues - November 2021

## Attendees

* [Jan Ainali](https://publiccode.net/who-we-are/team/jan-ainali.html)
* [Eric Herman](https://publiccode.net/who-we-are/team/eric-herman.html)

## Notes

We started by reviewing [the notes from the last session](https://blog.publiccode.net/community%20call/2021/09/13/pruning-the-oldest-issues.html) and immediately followed up on the ones needed action.

* [No navigation in web version #217](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/217) - we merged [the jekyll-theme pull request for this](https://github.com/publiccodenet/jekyll-theme/pull/74).
* [Introduction/certifying an entire codebase: unclear paragraph #218](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/218) - we talked about this in [the October community call](https://blog.publiccode.net/community%20call/2021/10/11/notes-from-community-call-7-october-2021.html). We will investigate modularity so the refactoring is on hold for now.
* [Document limitations of a codebase #219](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/219) - closed
* [Recommend responding to issues and pull requests in a timely manner #221](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/221) - we forgot to add explicit date so we will revisit by next meeting, close if no new suggestions.
* [Add engineering guidelines (in addition to Standard criteria 13 - use a coherent style) #222](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/222) - stays open, work session planned for November 18.

Then we created a [pull request](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/pull/535) for the Standard repository to implement the changes from the jekyll-theme change.
