# FOSDEM 2024 Public Code and Digital Public Goods devroom Call for Participation

We are happy to announce that the call for participation in the [FOSDEM 2024](https://fosdem.org/2024/) devroom for Public Code and [Digital Public Goods](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry) has opened.

It's a devroom dedicated to everyone developing public code - open source code that implements public policy, used for the public good, and by public organizations like governments, public administrations and state corporations.
Digital public goods (DPGs) are open-source software, open standards, open data, open AI systems, and open content collections that help meet the Sustainable Development Goals.

The devroom will take place on Saturday, 3 February 2024 in Brussels.

We're looking for contributions that fit within the main theme of the devroom. Below are some questions to inspire your proposal:

* have you tried to replicate or co-develop a codebase with another public organization? what did you learn along the way?
* do you have any procurement or governance models (or hacks!) that helped you use, reuse or co-develop public code or a digital public good?
* are you working on or using an amazing DPG or public code project with strong reuse potential that everyone should know about?

If you have another idea for a talk that you think would fit, please don't hesitate to let us know!
We hope that this will be an opportunity for everyone to meet and exchange ideas about public code and digital public goods around the world.

We offer two types of talk slots:

* 30 minutes (20 minutes presentation + 10 minutes Q&A)
* 5 minute lightning talks, perfect for presenting your project, but other lightning talk topics are also welcome!

Please specify in the Submission notes field which type you're applying for.
