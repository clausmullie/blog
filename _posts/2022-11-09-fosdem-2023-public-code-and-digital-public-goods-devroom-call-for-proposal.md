# FOSDEM 2023 Public Code and Digital Public Goods devroom Call for Participation

We are happy to announce that the call for participation in the [FOSDEM 2023](https://fosdem.org/2023/) devroom for Public Code and [Digital Public Goods](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/) has opened.

It's a devroom dedicated to everyone developing public code - open source code that implements public policy, used for the public good, and by public organizations like governments, public administrations and state corporations.

The devroom will take place on Sunday, 5 February 2023 in Brussels.

We're looking for contributions that would fit within the main theme of the devroom. Here are some questions that could inspire your proposal:

* have you tried to replicate and/or co-develop with another public organization? what did you learn along the way?
* do you have any procurement, collaboration or governance models (or hacks!) that helped you use, reuse and co-develop public code or a digital public good?
* are you working on or using an amazing digital public good or public codebase that the world needs to know about (and has potential for reuse)?

If you have any other ideas for a talk that would fit, let us know! We hope that this will be an opportunity for everyone to meet and exchange ideas about public code and digital public goods around the world.

We welcome submissions from projects that have never been to FOSDEM before, as well as from 'old timers'.

## Submission process

Please [submit your proposals](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM23) before **5 December 2022**.

If you already have a Pentabarf account (for example as a result of having submitted a proposal in the past), make sure you use it to log in and submit your proposal.

Do not create a new account if you already have one. Please provide a bit of information about yourself under Person -> Description -> Abstract.

When you submit your proposal (creating an "Event" in Pentabarf), make sure you choose the "Public Code and Digital Public Goods devroom" in the track drop-down menu. Otherwise your proposal might go unnoticed.
Fill in at least a title and abstract for the proposed talk and a suggested duration.

Bear in mind that a lot of the value in these meetings comes from the discussions, so please consider the talk-to-discussion-ratio in your proposal.

As we only have a half day for the entire track, you'll have a better chance of being accepted if you opt to make a shorter presentation.

## Important dates

* 5 December 2022: deadline for submission of proposals
* 15 December 2022 or before: announcement of final schedule
* 5 February 2023: devroom day - You must be available in person to present your talk

## Recordings

The talks are usually recorded on-site. Any recordings will be published under the same license as all FOSDEM content (CC-BY). By agreeing to present in the Public Code and Digital Public Goods devroom, you automatically give permission to be recorded.
