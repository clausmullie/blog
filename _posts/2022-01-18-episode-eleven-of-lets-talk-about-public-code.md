# Episode eleven of Let's talk about public code!

In the eleventh episode of Let's talk about public code, we talked to Gijs Hillenius.
We talked about policy for open source in the EU, it's development and what's coming up.

In 2021 the European Commission launched an Open Source Program Office and in December they made [a decision on the open source licensing and reuse of Commission software](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32021D1209(01)).
