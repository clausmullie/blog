# Episode eight of Let's talk about public code!

In the eighth episode of Let's talk about public code, and our first anniversary, we talked to Gabriella Gómez-Mont from Experimentalista.

With a background as Chief Creative Officer for Mexico City and founder of Laboratorio para la Ciudad, the award-wining experimental arm and creative think tank of the Mexico City government, alongside engagements in the Netherlands, UK, USA, South Korea and Canada, Gabriella have global perspective on public code.

We also revealed a [new strategic council]({% 2021-09-13-launching-our-strategic-council %}) for the Foundation for Public Code, and Gabriella is our first person on it.
