* [Eric Herman](https://publiccode.net/who-we-are/team/eric-herman.html)

## Notes

We reviewed [the notes from the last session]({% post_url 2022-01-20-pruning-the-oldest-issues %}) and had one outstanding issue:

* [Require machine readable API specifications #237](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/237)
    * We made a [pull request](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/pull/583) that adds further reading

Then we looked at the open pull request:

-[Expand Bundle policy and code to clearly include processes #573](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/pull/573) and made some improvements to the language (without changing the substance of the pull request)
