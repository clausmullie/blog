# Episode nine of Let's talk about public code!

We discussed why and how Etalab, as a state agency, engages with the French open source ecosystem.

Etalab is a department of the direction interministérielle du numérique (DINUM), which coordinates the design and implementation of the State's strategy in the data domain.
