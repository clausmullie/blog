## Log

We reviewed [the notes from the last session]({% post_url 2021-06-16-pruning-the-oldest-issues %}). No further action is needed on those for now.

* [Improving categories for recipients of the standard #213](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/213) - there is a point, let's bring this up in a community call to talk about all categories
* [Expand 'further reading' sections with references to diverse gov't resources #214](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/214) - retitled and moved to publiccode.net repository

* [No navigation in web version #217](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/217) - connected to [#512](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/512), work session planned for September 22
* [Introduction/certifying an entire codebase: unclear paragraph #218](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/218) - relates to the refactoring of the introduction, review [#521](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/pull/521) in light of this
* [Document limitations of a codebase #219](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/219) - revisit by next meeting, close if no new suggestions
* [Recommend responding to issues and pull requests in a timely manner #221](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/221) - already addressed by the criterion Require review of contributions, revisit by next meeting, close if no new suggestions
* [Review engineering guidelines of other FOSS foundations to find ones we can recommend to members #485](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/485) - the idea is good, but it should not live in the standard, transfered to the projects repository.
* [Add engineering guidelines (in addition to Standard criteria 13 - use a coherent style) #222](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/222) - stays open, work session planned for September 12
