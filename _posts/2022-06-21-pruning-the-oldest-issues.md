* [Eric Herman](https://publiccode.net/team/eric-herman.html)

## Notes

We started by reviewing [the notes from the last session]({% 2022-04-21-pruning-the-oldest-issues %}).

Then we continued with:

* [List of standards requirements in open-standards.md #238](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/238) - the proposal is still valid, a work session is being planned for 28 June
* [Standard lacks statements regarding operational requirements #267](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/267) - the proposal is still valid, a work session is being planned for 29 June
* [Submit external links to the Internet Archive #275](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/275) - the proposal is still valid, a work session is being planned for 30 June
* [Change MAY to SHOULD for code of conducts? #287](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/287) - relates to [Code of conduct could cater to public organizations better #330](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/330) as it could serve as a good example with a simpler one, a work session for that one is being planned for 4 July as we think it will solve several issues around code of conduct
* [Should we add issue templates to the repo? #291](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/291) - closed with comment
* [Add a public roadmap for the standard to Readme? #292](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/292) - will be discussed on the next community call
* [External executive summary? #302](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/302) - priority work during the summer
* [Add a citation.cff file #303](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/303) - closed with comment
* [Line breaks happening in unexpected places #306](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/306) - the bug is still present, a work session is being planned for 4 July
* [Clarify intersection of policy-defined vocabulary and Use Plain English #308](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/308) - already solved, closed
* [Do we need to have a philosophy for 'breaking changes'? #309](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/309) - will need some more thought, perhaps an addition to the introduction is the right way to go
