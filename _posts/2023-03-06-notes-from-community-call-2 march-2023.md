## Notes

When we recently changed the sections "Why this is important" to instead become an introduction to each criterion, we also noted that many of the sections "What this does not do" did not add a lot of value to the reader, and thus we created the issue [Review "What does this not do" sections #813](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/813).

Our first review inspired us to do some addtions to the introductions as some sections had high level insights in them. With that done, we felt that perhaps it would be best to remove all the sections entirely, as the little value that once only was there, have been added to the wider context instead.

During the call, there were additional insights from Johan and Martin.

It was observed that since as many of the  "What this does not do" bullet points refer to what other criteria does, those that are not "linking" in such way as to collectively sum up to "What the Standard for Public Code does not do". A unified section with that theme would fit well in the introduction.

It was also noted that unrelated to specific criteria, there are some misconceptions about the Standard for Public Code worth addressing there, for instance, that the Standard for Public Code should have any opinions about specific implementations of a codebase. This section could also be a place for us to differentiate the Standard for Public Code from other standards (we already have [issues on this topic](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues/200)).

As we are planning to reframe some of the text in the introduction, to which this suggestion at a glance aligns well with, we will bring this new idea into that work.
