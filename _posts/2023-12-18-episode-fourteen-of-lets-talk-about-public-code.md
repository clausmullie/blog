# Episode fourteen of Let's talk about public code!

In this fourteenth episode, we talked to Åsa Jagre at the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management and Konstantin Ay from Intunio working on a Jitsi plugin for Outlook. We focused on up-stream first development and code collaboration.

Unfortunately, Åsa had a bad cough, so we are reading her messages from chat in the interview.
